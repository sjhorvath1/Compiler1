This is the raw Eclipse project file for my final project at Augsburg College. It is the result of a yearlong effort to build a mini-Pascal to MIPS assembly compiler, and is absolutely one of the most difficult things I have ever written. I could have just neatly packaged everything in a jar file, or left you a zip of the Java files, but I think that the entirety of the project folder speaks more to my ability to write code in a large project. The user manual is enclosed, as are all development materials and source code. Please let me know if you have any questions at all. Thank you for taking the time to look at this.
