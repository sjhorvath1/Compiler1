Mini-Pascal to MIPS assembly compiler 
Thank you for taking the time to look at my mini-Pascal to MIPS assembly compiler. 
This was the culminating project for my time spent at Augsburg College, and represents some of the hardest and most 
thorough work I have put into a development project. 
Detailed instructions are the in the user manual, but to run the jar file located in the Deliverables folder, 
run it like any normal jar file, and include two arguments on the command line, the first is your input pascal file, 
and the second should be the name of your desired output file. 
Please feel free to contact me at any time with any questions.
Sincerely,
Sam Horvath
