# Compiler1
Mini-Pascal to MIPS assembly compiler 
Detailed instructions are the in the user manual, but to run the jar file located in the Deliverables folder, 
run it like any normal jar file, and include two arguments on the command line, the first is your input pascal file, 
and the second should be the name of your desired output file. An example is listed below.

Please feel free to contact me at any time with any questions.
Sincerely,
Sam Horvath
